This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks exploring Deep Learning.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.
The notebooks for the lessons are located in the `Lessons` folder. 

To get started, double click on the `Getting-Started.ipynb` file on the left, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.  You will eventually get to exercise cells that will require you to do some work.
